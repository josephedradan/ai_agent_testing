        Probably because all of the algorithms inside of search.py prevent you from moving into a _position that you
        already traversed, you can use an additional parameter to act similar to changing universes once you have
        reached a goal.

        Basically, you hash the _position along side the length of the set that contains the goal positions.
        When you reach a goal _position, the set's length is changed because you remove that _position from that set.
        The removal of a goal _position and the creation of the set is done before the creation of this object based
        on the previous HashableGoal object's list_tuple_order_traveled.
