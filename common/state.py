    A State specifies the full game state_pacman, including the food, list_capsule,
    player configurations and score changes.

    GameStates are used by the Game object to capture the actual state_pacman of the game and
    can be used by agents to reason about the game.

    Much of the information in a State is stored in a StateDataPacman object.  We
    strongly suggest that you access that data via the accessor methods below rather
    than referring to the StateDataPacman object directly.

    Note that in classic Pacman, Pacman is always player 0.
