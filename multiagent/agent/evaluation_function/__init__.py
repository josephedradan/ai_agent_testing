TYPE_EVALUATION_FUNCTION

Notes:
    The real TYPE_EVALUATION_FUNCTION wanted is something like
        Callable[[GameState, Union[Action, None]] 
    Where the None is optional as in the callable can be 
        _callable(GameState)
    OR
        _callable(GameState, Action)
    OR
        _callable(GameState, None)

    The closest you can can get to mimic this type is 
        Union[
        Callable[[GameState], float],
        Callable[[GameState, Action], float]
    ]
    HOWEVER; it does not support
        _callable(GameState)

    The solution to this problem is to use mypy, but I don't want to implement that because this problem
    should be solved in cPython
